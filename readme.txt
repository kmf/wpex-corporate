Corporate WordPress Theme by WPExplorer
 
== Description ==
 
The theme includes built-in custom post types for portfolio, staff and homepage “features”. This will make it easy for you to create a portfolio and staff page without having to use shortcodes or third party plugins. The homepage slider also uses a custom post type to make it easy to create and customize your homepage slider.

Corporate is the perfect theme to build your business website or personal portfolio. The theme includes support for staff, so you can add your employees, teammates, or friends so users know who’s behind the great work on your site. The portfolio supports images, galleries and videos so you can easily add all of your current and past projects to show off to family, friends and prospective clients. And let’s not forget the awesome blog that we’ve built into the theme, which is the ideal place to share news and upcoming events with your readers.
